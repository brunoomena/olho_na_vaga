# Hello

This is a crawler that help us to understand which skills are being demanded in brasilan job offers. 

We imagined a front end where people would be able to research for a job offer and get imediatelly the information of which skills this job offer is demanding, see the front end exemple in https://brunoomena.wixsite.com/projetointegrador (please, note that this is just a fake door at the moment)

There's also another exemple of how the data can be fed to power bi to generate an output like this https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDhkMjU5NTAtMjc3Zi00NGZhLWIxYzktMzNjN2ZiNTIxM2Y0IiwidCI6ImJiYjQ5MTE1LTE0ZmQtNGIxMC05YzIzLWNmNDFhNjFkOWNiOCJ9


Note that the regulamentation to webscraping was great gray area till the day that this project was commited and we should use it responsibly

Cheers,
Bruno Omena
